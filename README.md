NOTE: This is a work in progress!!!! (clearly just getting started)
# Intro
Hello! This is the start of me putting down what's in my head on testing in a continuous delivery world, my experiences, challenges I still face, and more. 

# Understanding DevOps and Continuous Delivery
I often hear these used interchangably - but I think it's important to distinguish the two terms. 

To me, DevOps is a culture. A state of mind, if you will. When I hear 'DevOps', I think immediately about three things: 
1. Collaboration 
2. Continuous Improvement
3. Continuous Learning

Continuous Delivery is a piece of the puzzle to become a high performing DevOps organization. If DevOps is about the culture needed to quickly release valuable services to our users, CD is the delivery mechanism to do that. 

I like to think about Continuous Delivery as a car driving on a road at night, and see Testing and Monitoring/Alerting (our feedback) as the head lights. We can drive down the road without them, but testing and feedback keep us from going off-road (and potentially wrecking our car!).

# How do I use the canvas?
# But what about manual testing?
# Risk Based Testing
# Continuous Deployment vs. Release
